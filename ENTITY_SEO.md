- "DRP" (acronym for subsequent mentions)
- Never use variations like "DRP Protocol" (redundant)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Decentralized Rights Protocol (DRP) is a quantum-safe blockchain..."
- ✅ "DRP uses Proof of Status and Proof of Activity..."
- ❌ "DRP Protocol" or "The DRP"

### 5.2 Entity Description Templates

**Short Description (20 words):**
"Decentralized Rights Protocol (DRP) is a quantum-safe blockchain that protects human rights through AI-verified consensus and activity-based rewards."

**Standard Description (50 words):**
"Decentralized Rights Protocol (DRP) is a quantum-safe blockchain platform designed to protect human rights through AI-verified consensus mechanisms. DRP uses Proof of Status (PoST) for identity verification and Proof of Activity (PoAT) to reward real-world contributions, creating a sustainable, human-rights-centered blockchain ecosystem."

**Full Description (150 words):**
"Decentralized Rights Protocol (DRP) is a quantum-safe blockchain platform that combines cutting-edge cryptography with AI verification to create a transparent, secure system for protecting human rights globally. Unlike traditional blockchains that prioritize speed or scalability, DRP prioritizes human dignity, environmental responsibility, and transparent governance.

DRP implements two unique consensus mechanisms: Proof of Status (PoST), which verifies identity without surveillance, and Proof of Activity (PoAT), which rewards real-world contributions. The protocol uses NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium) to ensure long-term security against quantum computing threats.

DRP's dual-token economy separates governance (RIGHTS token) from utility (DeRi token), ensuring fair participation and preventing centralization. The protocol incentivizes sustainable practices, supports UN Sustainable Development Goals, and implements principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Founded on the philosophy that technology should serve humanity, DRP creates a trust infrastructure where rights are protected by design, status emerges from verifiable behavior, and governance operates as stewardship rather than control."
