## Content Recommendations

### 1. Opening Paragraph (First 100 Words)

**Recommended Opening:**
"DRP Governance enables decentralized decision-making through RIGHTS tokens, Proof of Status (PoST), and community participation. Unlike centralized governance models, DRP governance ensures that all stakeholders can participate in protocol decisions through transparent, on-chain voting mechanisms. The governance system combines token-weighted voting with identity verification through PoST, ensuring that decisions reflect both economic stake and verified contributions. This human-rights-centered approach to governance prioritizes transparency, inclusivity, and accountability, creating a system where governance operates as stewardship rather than control."

### 2. Key Definitions

**Include inline definitions:**
- **Decentralized Governance:** A governance model where decision-making power is distributed among stakeholders rather than centralized in a single authority.
- **RIGHTS Token:** DRP's governance token that provides voting power in protocol decisions.
- **Proof of Status (PoST):** DRP's identity verification mechanism that encodes verified credentials without exposing private data.
- **Token-Weighted Voting:** A voting system where voting power is proportional to token holdings.

### 3. Internal Linking

**Link to:**
- Philosophy page (governance principles)
- Economics pages (token distribution, tokenomics)
- Whitepaper (technical specifications)
- Community page (participation)
- Learn modules (educational content)

### 4. FAQ Section

**Include FAQ questions:**
- How does DRP governance work?
- How can I participate in governance?
- What are RIGHTS tokens?
- How does Proof of Status affect governance?
- How are proposals executed?
- What is token-weighted voting?

### 5. Schema.org Markup
