# Consensus Mechanisms

## What is Consensus?

Consensus mechanisms are the protocols that allow blockchain networks to agree on the state of the ledger without a central authority. They ensure that all participants in the network have the same version of the truth.

## Types of Consensus Mechanisms

### Proof of Work (PoW)
- Used by Bitcoin and Ethereum (pre-merge)
- Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles
- High energy consumption but proven security
- Example: Bitcoin's SHA-256 hashing

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Validators are chosen based on their stake
- More energy efficient than PoW
- Examples: Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Polkadot

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Token holders vote for delegates
- Faster transaction processing
- Examples: EOS, TRON

## DRP's Unique Approach

The Decentralized Rights Protocol uses a hybrid consensus mechanism combining:

1. **Proof of Status (PoST)** - Validates human rights activities
2. **Proof of Activity (PoAT)** - Ensures continuous engagement

This dual approach ensures both security and meaningful participation in human rights protection.

## Key Concepts

- **Finality**: The point at which a transaction cannot be reversed
- **Fork**: When the blockchain splits into multiple versions
- **51% Attack**: When a single entity controls majority of network power
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Ability to function despite malicious nodes
