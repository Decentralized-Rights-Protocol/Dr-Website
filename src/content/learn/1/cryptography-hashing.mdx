# Cryptography & Hashing

Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain security. In this lesson, you'll learn how cryptographic techniques protect data and ensure the integrity of blockchain networks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of cryptography in blockchain
- Explain how hash functions work
- Describe public and private key cryptography
- Identify different types of cryptographic algorithms

## What is Cryptography?

**Cryptography** is the practice of securing information by converting it into a form that only authorized parties can understand. In blockchain, cryptography ensures:

- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized parties can read the data
- **Integrity**: Data cannot be altered without detection
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of participants
- **Non-repudiation**: Preventing denial of transactions

## Hash Functions

A **hash function** is a mathematical function that takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size output called a hash or digest.

### Key Properties of Hash Functions

1. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same output
2. **One-way**: Easy to compute hash from input, nearly impossible to reverse
3. **Fixed Output Size**: Always produces the same length output
4. **Avalanche Effect**: Small input changes cause large output changes

### Common Hash Functions

- **SHA-256**: Used in Bitcoin, produces 256-bit output
- **Keccak-256**: Used in Ethereum, produces 256-bit output
- **Blake2**: Faster alternative with good security properties

### Example Hash Function

```
Input: "Hello, DRP!"
SHA-256 Output: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

## Public and Private Key Cryptography

Also known as **asymmetric cryptography**, this system uses two mathematically related keys:

### Private Key
- **Secret**: Only the owner knows it
- **Used for**: Signing transactions, decrypting messages
- **Must be kept secure**: Loss means loss of access

### Public Key
- **Public**: Can be shared with anyone
- **Used for**: Verifying signatures, encrypting messages
- **Derived from**: Private key using mathematical operations

### Digital Signatures

Digital signatures prove that:
1. The message was created by the private key holder
2. The message hasn't been tampered with
3. The sender cannot deny sending the message

## Cryptographic Algorithms

### Symmetric Cryptography
- **Same key** for encryption and decryption
- **Faster** than asymmetric cryptography
- **Used for**: Bulk data encryption
- **Examples**: AES, DES

### Asymmetric Cryptography
- **Different keys** for encryption and decryption
- **Slower** but more secure
- **Used for**: Key exchange, digital signatures
- **Examples**: RSA, ECDSA

## Blockchain Applications

### Transaction Signing
Every blockchain transaction is signed with the sender's private key, proving ownership and authorization.

### Block Hashing
Each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating an immutable chain.

### Merkle Trees
Efficient way to verify large amounts of data using hash functions arranged in a tree structure.

### Address Generation
Blockchain addresses are derived from public keys using hash functions.

## Security Considerations

### Key Management
- **Hardware wallets**: Store keys in secure hardware
- **Software wallets**: Store keys in encrypted software
- **Paper wallets**: Physical storage of keys

### Quantum Computing Threat
- Current cryptographic algorithms may be vulnerable
- **Post-quantum cryptography** is being developed
- **Lattice-based** and **hash-based** algorithms are promising

## Real-World Examples

### Bitcoin
- Uses SHA-256 for hashing
- ECDSA for digital signatures
- Addresses derived from public keys

### Ethereum
- Uses Keccak-256 for hashing
- ECDSA for digital signatures
- Account-based model with addresses

### DRP
- Implements quantum-resistant algorithms
- Uses advanced cryptographic proofs
- Ensures long-term security

## Key Takeaways

- Cryptography is essential for blockchain security
- Hash functions provide data integrity
- Public/private key pairs enable secure transactions
- Digital signatures prove authenticity
- Proper key management is crucial for security

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, you'll learn about consensus mechanisms and how they work with cryptography to secure blockchain networks.
