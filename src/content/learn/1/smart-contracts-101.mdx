# Smart Contracts 101

## What are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on blockchain networks. They automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

## Key Characteristics

- **Autonomous**: Execute automatically when conditions are met
- **Transparent**: Code is visible to all participants
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed once deployed
- **Trustless**: No need for third-party verification

## How Smart Contracts Work

1. **Deployment**: Contract code is deployed to the blockchain
2. **Trigger**: External event or transaction triggers the contract
3. **Execution**: Contract logic runs automatically
4. **Result**: State changes are recorded on the blockchain

## Common Use Cases

### Financial Applications
- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
- Lending and borrowing protocols
- Automated market makers (AMMs)

### Identity and Access
- Digital identity verification
- Access control systems
- Authentication protocols

### Supply Chain
- Product tracking and verification
- Automated compliance checking
- Quality assurance systems

## DRP Smart Contracts

The Decentralized Rights Protocol uses smart contracts for:

- **Activity Verification**: Automatically verify human rights activities
- **Reward Distribution**: Distribute $DeRi tokens for contributions
- **Governance**: Enable community voting and decision-making
- **Identity Management**: Manage user credentials and permissions

## Programming Languages

### Solidity
- Most popular for Ethereum
- JavaScript-like syntax
- Extensive documentation and tools

### Rust
- Used by Solana and Polkadot
- Memory-safe and performant
- Growing ecosystem

### Move
- Used by Aptos and Sui
- Designed for blockchain applications
- Focus on security and safety

## Best Practices

1. **Security First**: Always audit your code
2. **Gas Optimization**: Write efficient code to reduce costs
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test before deployment
5. **Documentation**: Document your code clearly

## Common Vulnerabilities

- **Reentrancy**: Contract calls itself before completing
- **Integer Overflow**: Numbers exceed maximum value
- **Access Control**: Unauthorized access to functions
- **Front-running**: Transactions executed before yours
