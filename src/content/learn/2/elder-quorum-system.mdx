# Elder Quorum System

## What is the Elder Quorum?

The Elder Quorum is DRP's core governance mechanism, consisting of trusted validators who maintain network integrity and make critical decisions about the protocol's future.

## Key Components

- **Community Voting**: Network participants vote for candidates
- **Rotation System**: Regular rotation to prevent centralization
- **Reputation Scoring**: Based on historical performance

### Quorum Requirements
- **Minimum Threshold**: 2/3 majority required for decisions
- **Geographic Diversity**: Elders from different regions
- **Expertise Areas**: Specialists in various human rights domains
- **Active Participation**: Regular engagement required

## Elder Responsibilities

### Network Validation
- Validate transactions and blocks
