- Organize events
- Translate documentation

### Getting Started

#### 1. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/drp-protocol/drp-core.git
cd drp-core

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start local node
npm run node
```

#### 2. Find Contribution Opportunities

**Ways to Find Issues**:
- GitHub Issues labeled "good first issue"
- Community discussions
- Feature requests
- Bug reports
- Documentation gaps

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# Browse issues
gh issue list --label "good first issue"

# Claim an issue
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "I'll work on this"

# Create branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-123
```

#### 3. Development Workflow

**Branch Naming**:
- `feature/description`: New features
- `fix/description`: Bug fixes
- `docs/description`: Documentation
- `refactor/description`: Code refactoring

**Commit Messages**:
```
feat: Add royalty distribution batching
fix: Resolve gas estimation error
docs: Update SDK installation guide
refactor: Optimize activity proof verification
```

### Code Contribution Process

#### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drp-core.git
cd drp-core

# Add upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/drp-protocol/drp-core.git
```

#### 2. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-contribution
```

#### 3. Make Changes

**Follow Coding Standards**:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code style
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

**Example**:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates royalty distribution for multiple recipients
 * @param amount Total amount to distribute
 * @param recipients Array of recipients with their shares
 * @returns Array of distribution amounts
 */
export function calculateRoyalties(
  amount: bigint,
  recipients: Recipient[]
): bigint[] {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### 4. Write Tests

**Test Requirements**:
- Unit tests for new functions
- Integration tests for features
- Edge case coverage
- Maintain existing test coverage

**Example**:
```typescript
describe('calculateRoyalties', () => {
  it('should distribute correctly', () => {
    const amount = parseEther('100')
    const recipients = [
      { address: '0x1', share: 80 },
      { address: '0x2', share: 20 }
    ]
    
    const result = calculateRoyalties(amount, recipients)
    
    expect(result[0]).toBe(parseEther('80'))
    expect(result[1]).toBe(parseEther('20'))
  })
})
```
