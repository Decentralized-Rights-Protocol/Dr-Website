# DRP Development Kit

Welcome to the DRP Development Kit (DRP-DK)! This comprehensive toolkit provides everything you need to build decentralized applications on the DRP network.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand what the DRP Development Kit includes
- Set up your development environment
- Install and configure DRP-DK
- Create your first DRP application
- Use DRP's core libraries and APIs

## What is DRP-DK?

The **DRP Development Kit** is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation designed to simplify building on the DRP network. It includes:

- **Core Libraries**: TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs for DRP
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for development
- **Testing Framework**: Tools for testing DRP applications
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API references

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Install DRP-DK

```bash
npm install @drp/sdk @drp/cli
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @drp/sdk @drp/cli
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Initialize a New Project

```bash
npx @drp/cli create my-drp-app
cd my-drp-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DRP_NETWORK=testnet
DRP_NODE_URL=https://testnet.drp.network
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
```

## Core Components

### DRP SDK

The SDK provides programmatic access to DRP:

```typescript
import { DRPClient } from '@drp/sdk';

const client = new DRPClient({
  network: 'testnet',
  nodeUrl: process.env.DRP_NODE_URL
});
```

### Smart Contracts

Deploy and interact with smart contracts:

```typescript
import { Contract } from '@drp/sdk';

const contract = await Contract.deploy({
  code: contractBytecode,
  initParams: {}
});
```

### Transactions

Send transactions on the DRP network:

```typescript
const tx = await client.sendTransaction({
  to: recipientAddress,
  value: amount,
  data: transactionData
});
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Write Your Code

Create your application logic using DRP SDK:

```typescript
// src/app.ts
import { DRPClient } from '@drp/sdk';

async function main() {
  const client = new DRPClient();
  // Your application logic
}
```

### 2. Test Locally

Use the local test network:

```bash
npm run test:local
```

### 3. Deploy to Testnet

Deploy your application:

```bash
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### 4. Deploy to Mainnet

Once tested, deploy to mainnet:

```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never commit private keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling
- Test thoroughly before mainnet deployment

### Performance
- Optimize contract code
- Use efficient data structures
- Monitor gas/transaction costs
- Implement caching where appropriate

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Token Creation
Create custom tokens on DRP:

```typescript
const token = await Token.create({
  name: 'MyToken',
  symbol: 'MTK',
  totalSupply: 1000000
});
```

### 2. NFT Marketplace
Build NFT functionality:

```typescript
const nft = await NFT.mint({
  metadata: { name: 'Artwork #1', image: '...' }
});
```

### 3. DeFi Applications
Create DeFi protocols:

```typescript
const pool = await Pool.create({
  tokenA: token1,
  tokenB: token2
});
```

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to build complete DApps using these tools and concepts.
