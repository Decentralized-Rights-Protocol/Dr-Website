## 3. Anchor Text Strategy

### 3.1 Best Practices

**Use Descriptive, Keyword-Rich Anchor Text:**
- ✅ "Proof of Status (PoST)" instead of "click here"
- ✅ "DRP governance model" instead of "this page"
- ✅ "quantum-safe blockchain" instead of "more info"
- ✅ "RIGHTS token" instead of "token"

**Include Context:**
- ✅ "Learn about DRP's Proof of Status mechanism"
- ✅ "Read the technical whitepaper for details"
- ✅ "Explore DRP governance participation"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Generic terms: "click here", "read more", "this"
- ❌ Over-optimized exact match keywords
- ❌ Too many internal links (max 5-7 per section)

### 3.2 Anchor Text Examples by Concept

**Proof of Status (PoST):**
- "Proof of Status (PoST)"
- "DRP's identity verification mechanism"
- "PoST consensus mechanism"
- Link to: /learn, /economics/governance, /whitepaper

**Proof of Activity (PoAT):**
- "Proof of Activity (PoAT)"
- "activity verification mechanism"
- "PoAT consensus"
- Link to: /learn, /economics/abe, /whitepaper

**RIGHTS Token:**
- "RIGHTS token"
- "DRP governance token"
- "RIGHTS token governance"
- Link to: /economics/tokenomics, /economics/governance

**DeRi Token:**
- "DeRi token"
- "DRP utility token"
- "DeRi token utility"
- Link to: /economics/tokenomics, /economics/abe

**Governance:**
- "DRP governance"
- "decentralized governance"
- "governance model"
- Link to: /economics/governance, /philosophy

**Quantum-Safe:**
- "quantum-safe cryptography"
- "post-quantum security"

## 4. Contextual Linking Guidelines

### 4.1 When to Link

**Link When:**
- First mention of a key concept (PoST, PoAT, RIGHTS, DeRi)
- Explaining a concept that has a dedicated page
- Referencing technical details available elsewhere
- Providing additional context or resources
- Connecting related concepts

**Don't Link When:**
- Concept is already explained on current page
- Link would interrupt reading flow
- Too many links in a single paragraph (max 2-3)
- Link is redundant or unnecessary

### 4.2 Contextual Link Examples

**Example 1: PoST Mention**
"DRP uses Proof of Status (PoST) for identity verification without surveillance. [Link: Proof of Status mechanism] This ensures that status emerges from verifiable behavior rather than authority."

**Example 2: Governance Reference**
"DRP governance enables decentralized decision-making through RIGHTS tokens. [Link: DRP governance model] All stakeholders can participate in protocol decisions through transparent, on-chain voting."

**Example 3: Economic Model**
"DRP implements a Sustainable Rights Economy (SRE) that ties value to verified human activity. [Link: DRP economics] This ensures economic rewards align with human rights principles."
