CURSOR INSTRUCTIONS — DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING PAGES

You MUST follow these rules:

1. Do not modify or regenerate any existing files unless I explicitly say so.
This includes:

src/app/page.tsx

src/app/layout.tsx

src/components/**

src/styles/**

Any existing section pages (Why DRP, Tokens, Docs, etc.)



2. All new features must be added ONLY inside new folders that you create under:

src/app/new/
src/components/new/
src/app/learn/
src/content/learn/

and must never touch or rewrite other code.


3. DO NOT change or remove the DRP design system

gradients

particle background

typography

Tailwind config

layout structure

navbar

footer



4. Any new UI must match existing DRP styling automatically.
Use the same spacing, colors, fonts, animations.


5. If you need code from an existing file, read it but DO NOT overwrite it.



⭐️ ROUTING REQUIREMENT

Use the existing global layout but do not alter it.


⭐️ SAFETY CHECK

Before writing any file, ask:

> “This file already exists. Should I create a new version in /new/ instead of touching it?”



If yes → create file in /new/.
