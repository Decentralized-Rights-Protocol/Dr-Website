## 5. Internal Linking Strategy

### 5.1 Hub and Spoke Model

**Hub Pages (High Authority):**
- Homepage (/)
- Whitepaper (/whitepaper)
- Philosophy (/philosophy)
- Governance (/economics/governance)

**Spoke Pages (Supporting Content):**
- Economics pages (/economics/*)
- Documentation (/docs)
- Learn modules (/learn/*)
- Community (/community)

### 5.2 Internal Linking Rules

1. **Every page should link to:**
   - Homepage (in navigation)
   - Philosophy page (at least once in content)
   - Whitepaper (if relevant)
   - Relevant economics/governance pages

2. **Homepage should link to:**
   - All major sections (Philosophy, Whitepaper, Governance, Economics, Docs, Learn, Community)
   - Key concepts (PoST, PoAT, RIGHTS token, DeRi token)

3. **Philosophy page should link to:**
   - Whitepaper (technical details)
   - Governance page (implementation)
   - Economics pages (economic model)
   - Learn modules (educational content)

4. **Whitepaper page should link to:**
   - Philosophy (foundational principles)

   - Documentation (technical details)

5. **Governance page should link to:**
   - Philosophy (governance principles)
   - Economics pages (token distribution)
   - Whitepaper (technical specifications)
   - Community (participation)

### 5.3 Anchor Text Strategy

**Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text:**
- ✅ "Proof of Status (PoST)" instead of "click here"
- ✅ "DRP governance model" instead of "this page"
- ✅ "quantum-safe blockchain" instead of "more info"
- ✅ "RIGHTS token" instead of "token"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Generic terms like "click here", "read more", "this"
- ❌ Over-optimized exact match keywords
- ❌ Too many internal links (max 5-7 per page)

### 5.4 Contextual Linking

**Link in context:**
- When mentioning PoST → link to learn module or governance page
- When mentioning PoAT → link to economics/ABE page
- When mentioning RIGHTS token → link to economics/tokenomics page
- When mentioning sustainability → link to economics/SRE page
- When mentioning human rights → link to philosophy page

3. **DRP Full Description (150 words):**
   "Decentralized Rights Protocol (DRP) is a quantum-safe blockchain platform that combines cutting-edge cryptography with AI verification to create a transparent, secure system for protecting human rights globally. Unlike traditional blockchains that prioritize speed or scalability, DRP prioritizes human dignity, environmental responsibility, and transparent governance.

   DRP implements two unique consensus mechanisms: Proof of Status (PoST), which verifies identity without surveillance, and Proof of Activity (PoAT), which rewards real-world contributions. The protocol uses NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium) to ensure long-term security against quantum computing threats.

   DRP's dual-token economy separates governance (RIGHTS token) from utility (DeRi token), ensuring fair participation and preventing centralization. The protocol incentivizes sustainable practices, supports UN Sustainable Development Goals, and implements principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

   Founded on the philosophy that technology should serve humanity, DRP creates a trust infrastructure where rights are protected by design, status emerges from verifiable behavior, and governance operates as stewardship rather than control."

### 7.4 Structured Data for AI

**Use semantic HTML:**
- `<article>` for main content
- `<section>` for major sections
- `<aside>` for related content
- `<time>` for dates
- `<address>` for contact info
- `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` for definitions

**Use microdata where appropriate:**
- `itemscope`, `itemtype`, `itemprop` for entities
- Schema.org types for all major entities

### 7.5 AI-Friendly Content Structure

**Best Practices:**
1. **Clear hierarchy:** Use proper H1-H6 structure
2. **Summary sections:** Add "Key Takeaways" at end of long pages
3. **Bullet points:** Use lists for scannable content
4. **Definitions inline:** Define terms on first use
5. **Cross-references:** Link to related concepts
6. **Date stamps:** Include publication/update dates
7. **Author attribution:** Credit content creators
8. **Citations:** Link to sources and references
