# ✅ 404 Issue Fixed - All Pages Now Working

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Pages Deployed Successfully

---

## 🐛 Root Cause

The issue was an **empty `app/` directory at the root level** that was conflicting with `src/app/`. Next.js was detecting the empty root `app/` directory instead of `src/app/`, causing it to think there were no pages to build.

### What Was Happening:

- Next.js detected empty root `app/` directory
- Ignored `src/app/` directory with all the actual pages
- Only built 2 pages (404 and 500 error pages)
- All other pages returned 404

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

1. **Removed empty root `app/` directory**
   - This allowed Next.js to properly detect `src/app/`

2. **Removed `output: 'standalone'` from next.config.js**
   - This setting is for Docker deployments
   - Not needed for Vercel and can cause issues
